//! Groundwork for syncing between devices (no server yet).
//!
//! Every change to a database, its schema or its rows is stamped with a
//! hybrid logical clock: wall-clock milliseconds, a counter for changes in
//! the same millisecond, and this copy's device id, written so that comparing
//! two stamps as strings orders them in time. When two copies change the same
//! field, the later stamp wins on both, so they end up identical whichever
//! order they hear about each other's changes in.
//!
//! The outbox lists what changed since the last sync (one entry per record,
//! not a growing log). A sync service will send those records, apply what
//! comes back with `Db::sync_apply`, and clear what was sent.
